# Raspberry-Pi
Drive an LCD 16x2 display with Raspberry Pi

*Some projects for the Raspberry Pi require a display to show information or messages. The LCD 16x02 display is ideal for showing limited text. It is inexpensive, relatively easy to setup and program. It can show up to 2 lines of 16 characters. This project will demonstrate how to connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the 1602 LCD and then configure and display text using Python programming.*
